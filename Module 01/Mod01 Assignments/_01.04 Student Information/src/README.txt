<+s>: Using the VS Code editor was easy. Using both print and println was easy, and this assignment was also very
     simple and straightforward.

<-s>: I would sometimes type too fast and forget the semicolon, but other than that it was easy. I don't like the syntax 
     for print statements in Java as I am used to programming in Python.

In the future, I'll make sure I take my time so I don't forget anything related to the syntax of Java.
