<+s>: Using the VS Code editor was easy. Using both print and println was easy, and this assignment was also very
      simplistic and straight forward.

<-s>: I would sometimes type to fast and forget the semicolon, but other than that it was easy.

In the future: I'll make sure I take my time so I don't forget anything related to the syntax of Java.
